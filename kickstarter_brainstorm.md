* Good video basically a requirement. Good video == funded. Bad video == unfunded. Writing probably not enough.

## Video Concepts

* All parady
  * Used car sales
  * Oxyclean-style studio infomercial
  * Ron Popeal(sp?) studio audience infomercial
  * Crazy Carpet Closeout-style video (Don's guns etc.)
  * Political campaign ad
    * Attack ad on cables?
    * The "modern values" candidate?
* Parady followed by "straight" video
* 100% straight explanatory video

## Video ideas

### Main Video
 * 90-120 seconds (quick enough to explain, but leaves some things requiring reading the text)
 * Entertaining hook to start (parody or "has this ever happened to you?")
 * Explains the product
 * Emotional bond with audience (not corporate, dudes in a garage, gamers, scratching our itch)
3 or 4 follow

### Secondary Videos

Follow-up videos important to make kickstarter pages and encourage viral propogation via existing fans.

* Additional parody videos
* Videos of us playing the AC
* Random shit, but must have a good entertainment to length ratio

awesome controller works for your blender? I don't know what sort of crazy
thing you're in to, so please stop asking.

(Plus all previous tiers)

### $85
The Awesome Controller-havers tier

This is where you want to be if you'd like a retail version of the Awesome
Controller. We will ship you a gorgeously-designed, fully-functional,
envy-causing Awesome Controller. You will love it, or Kail will
eat a sock. Seriously though, satisfaction gauranteed. Sock-eating optional.

### $120
The Hacker-Helper tier

Want to get in to arduino hacking but afraid that written documentation ain't
enough? Have an awesome idea on how to expand Awesome Controller but maybe
you're not a hardcore bluetooth afficienado? With this tier, you'll recieve
everything in The Hackers tier plus have priority email/skype access to the
Awesome Controller team for advice and feedback. 

You can pick our brains regarding dating, fashion and politics, but our comparative
advantage tends to be in software. Your call though, because we are pretty
awesome.
