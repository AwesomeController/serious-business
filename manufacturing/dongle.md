Dongle Manufacturing:

NES/SNES/N64 connectors:

Use Ponoko to manufacturer connectors with specs of the Nintendo connectors.  Specs of the connectors could not be found, so we would have to reverse engineer the connectors by making our own measurements.  We would have to make our own 3d model using something like Google Sketchup.  This seems like a lot of work for our initial run of Awesome Controllers.

Proposal is to use NES/SNES/N64 controller extensions that will allow us to cut them in half and use one half for dongle use.  Found that we can purchase these for around $4 a piece.

Awesome Controller Connectors:

Use usb connectors for connection of the dongle to the Arduino.  We can purchase a connector and wire them ourselves, but the quality would not be there quite as good as consumer electronics.  Most usb connectors on the market have molded covers, so that would be difficult to reproduce.

Proposal is to use mini usb cable extensions that can be purchased for around $4 a piece.  This would cover the connection from the Arduino and allow any gaming connector to be wired to the usb dongle.  We can use heat shrink wire wrap in order to make the connection between the mini usb connector and the gaming connector.
