## Body Copy (fuck it, we're doing 5 blades)

### Prepare Yourself

There comes a time in a person's life where they must decide if they're going
to make history or just be history. Fuck that choice. We're changing history, you and me. 

Some sad people are content playing their baller old console games on the
miserable excuse for controller technology we had available in the 80's and
90's. 
(80's pop culture degradation quip?) 
We are not those people. 
Play Zelda with a barely-rounded rectangle? Shut your mouth.

Let me break it down to what business douches call a Value Proposition:

	  Retro Console (NES/SNES/N64/Genesis)
	  Awesome Controller
	+ Modern Controller (Wii/PS3) 
	-----------------------------------------
	Fucking Victory

### The Ballad of Awesome Controller

It was the mild Indianapolis Winter of 2011. 
Kyle Shipley, Awesome Controller's Benevolent Dictator For Life 
and the hero of our story, 
is in the midst of his standard Saturday free-climb 
on the side of Indianapolis' tallest building. 
Today's climb was different than the previous dozens, however, 
as our hero was struggling with an important question. 
What is the most impactful thing he could do 
to improve the plight of gamers everywhere?

After traversing the 25-floor fixtures one handed 
and break-dance shuffling sideways to the East side of the Chase Tower 
for the final ascent, 
his mind cleared just enough to let in a long-repressed memory. 
Cats, Chords, Zelda, Pain. 
Kyle was just a young master-gamer when his pet Mountain Lion, Lucky, 
pulled the power chord on the final boss in Zelda 7, 
ruining his world-record perfect 14-hour speed run. 

"That sucked, but how could that have been avoided?" 
Kyle asked out loud to both himself 
and the tens of thousands of adoring fans 
watching his ascent via UStream. 
Then it hit him! 
Not the idea for Awesome Controller, 
but approximately 10k volts of electricity from a nearby cloud. 
The layman's term is "lightning."

After a brief hospital stint 
where he recovered from the damage he caused the concrete, 
Kyle awoke with the nugget of the idea that would become Awesome Controller. 
Awesome Controller is the controller that isn't a controller.
It's the controller that frees you from decades old controller technology 
and opens your retro gaming world to the modern controller of your choice. 
Viva la Awesome Controller!

## Body Copy (straight up)

### Control Your Retro Games in a New Way



## Video Concepts

* All parody
  * Used car sales
  * Oxyclean-style studio infomercial
  * Ron Popeal(sp?) studio audience infomercial
  * Crazy Carpet Closeout-style video (Don's guns etc.)
  * Political campaign ad
    * Attack ad on cables?
    * The "modern values" candidate
  * Kitten-mittens "Has this ever happened to you?" Grievous bodily harm caused by plugging in the controller
  * Video game tropes IRL
    * Break a block above your head
    * Open a treasure chest (music, camera angles)
    * Drive a car over a question mark block
    * Guitar hero streaming notes
    * Plugging in the chorded controller changes the world from awesomeness video game mode to grey "real world" mode
    * Tetris: building awesome controller with an arduino? Boxes?
    * Ocarina of time Navi, annoying fairy. "Listen!"
    * 
* Parody followed by "straight" video
* 100% straight explanatory video

## Video ideas

### Main Video
 * 90-120 seconds (quick enough to explain, but leaves some things requiring reading the text)
 * Entertaining hook to start (parody or "has this ever happened to you?")
 * Explains the product
 * Emotional bond with audience (not corporate, dudes in a garage, gamers, scratching our itch)
3 or 4 follow

### Secondary Videos

Follow-up videos important to make Kickstarter pages and encourage viral propagation via existing fans.

* Additional parody videos
* Videos of us playing the AC
* Random shit, but must have a good entertainment to length ratio

## Video Script

Dot dot dot.

## Reward Tiers

Possible change: Name tiers based on video game characters 
(eg. The Backers Tier is a character that gives you things. Old man from Zelda.)

### $10

### $80
The Hackers tier

We will send you a parts kit with everything you need to solder your own
Awesome Controller arduino shield. With this kit, an arduino uno and our free
tutorials and documentation, you too can be a baller hardware hacking machine.

If you already are the aforementioned baller hardware-hacking machine (BHHM)
then you can use these parts to add your own twists to the hardware. Maybe your
awesome controller works for your blender? I don't know what sort of crazy
thing you're in to, so please stop asking. 

Also includes 1 system dongle of your choice (add $10 for each additional
dongle you'd like).

Please add $15 for non-US shipping.

(Plus all previous tiers)

Estimated arrival: July 2012

### $95
The Awesome Controller-havers tier

This is where you want to be if you'd like a retail version of the Awesome
Controller. We will ship you a gorgeously-designed, fully-functional,
envy-causing Awesome Controller. You will love it, or Kail will
eat a sock. Seriously though, satisfaction guaranteed. Sock-eating optional.

Please add $15 for non-US shipping.

(Plus all previous tiers minus the Awesome Controller shield)

Estimated arrival: September 2012

### $130
The Hacker-Helper tier

Want to get in to arduino hacking but afraid that written documentation ain't
enough? Have an awesome idea on how to expand Awesome Controller but maybe
you're not a hardcore bluetooth aficionado? With this tier, you'll receive
everything in The Hackers tier plus have priority email/skype access to the
Awesome Controller team for advice and feedback. 

You can pick our brains regarding dating, fashion and politics, but our comparative
advantage tends to be in software. Your call though, because we are pretty
awesome.

Estimated arrival: July 2012

### $2000
The System-Benefactor tier

Have a favorite system/console that Awesome Controller doesn't support? Become
a system benefactor and we'll work with you to add Awesome Controller support
to that system. If you pick a system that we can't support due to very specific
technical issues, you can totally have your money back. We will try really
really hard to support your system though.

(Plus all previous rewards)

Estimated arrival: December 2012
