# Awesome Controller

## Wes

Awesome Controller lets you use your Wii and PS3 controllers to play your classic game consoles.

Imagine using your Wiimote to play a game of Contra on your original NES. Later, you battle your friends on Block Fort in Mario Kart 64 with your PS3 controllers!

If the past, present, and future had a baby, that baby would be Awesome Controller.

Hi, I'm Kyle and this is team Awesome Controller. We're five life-long gamers in Indianapolis.

I am a little bit of a wire-management freak, and I got tired of untangling the wires on my Super Nintendo controllers every time I wanted to replay Chrono Trigger. I Tom Sawyered four of my good friends and we built a working prototype of Awesome Controller in one weekend. Since then, we've worked hard to add support for new systems and new controllers. Now we want to share our hard work with all of you.

We launched this Kickstarter because it allows us to perform a larger production run, saving the maximum possible number of retro consoles from obscurity.

Awesome Controller acts like a translater between your Wii or PS3 controllers and your game consoles. We built on existing research to translate the bluetooth signals to the protocols that the various game consoles understand. You connect your Awesome Controller via an interchangable dongle to your favorite system, sync your controller, and start playing. You'll only need one Awesome Controller, but you'll need a different dongle for each game console.

We strongly believe that open hardware and software result in a better experience for consumers, so we've already released all of our Awesome Controller work under open source licenses. Our goal is to create a community around the Awesome Controller, so others can freely customize their version. We're also releasing an Arduino shield version of Awesome Controller for developers and hardware hackers.

## Alex

Our goal with Awesome Controller is to help people have more fun with the consoles they already own, and we need your help. Don't let your princess be in another castle. Support Awesome Controller. It's awesome. Controller.
