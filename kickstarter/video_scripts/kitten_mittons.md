# Kitten Mittons (sic)

## Concept

An ad in the comically-bad 
style of ASIF's [Kitten Mittons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNnEmd9jw8).

* Mix of spokesperson
  and voice-over.
* Huge exaggeration of AC impact.
* Awkward video editing.
* Hokey transition and sound effects.

## Script

(
Opens with a tight shot of the spokesperson
standing in a hacker-space.
Camera zooms out during opening line
revealing rest of AC team working at lab benches.
Spokesperson is awkwardly dressed 
in either poorly-tied tie or bowtie. 
Has obvious pit stains.
Speaks too loud.
Over the top facial expressions.
Awkward speaking cadence,
obviously trying to remember memorized lines.
Random hand gestures.
)

**Spokesperson(SP)**: Hello! 
I'm <name>, 
Awesome Controller Co-Founder 
and retro gaming enthusiast.

**SP**: Are your retro gaming console controllers
constantly causing you bodily harm?

*Cut to video of cord strangling*
**SP**: Do you often worry that 
your Nintendo cord will become wrapped around your neck, 
suffocating you?

*Cut to video of hand being pulled off by controller*
**SP**: Have you lost 
one, two, three or more hands 
as a result of controller cord accident?

*Cut back to Spokesperson, now walking towards the camera*
**SP**: If you answered yes to any of these questions, 
then you aren't alone, 
you single-handed son of a bitch.
I actually lost both of my hands to a Sega Genesis, 

*Cut to bloody no-hands aftermath*

so I vowed to stop the violence.

*Back to SP walking towards camera with lab in background*

I commission a team of top scientists and engineers
to research potential solutions
and bingo was his name-o.
Awesome Controller was born.

*Still walking towards the camera*

**SP**: With Awesome Controller,
you use your existing wiimote or PS3 controller

*off camera tosses controllers,*
*SP tries to catch one, misses,*
*other hits SP in the head*

to control your 
Nintendo, 
Super Nintendo, 
Nintendo 64 
or Sega Genesis.
Take back the control from your controllers again.
Awesome Controller.
It's Awesome.
Controller.
