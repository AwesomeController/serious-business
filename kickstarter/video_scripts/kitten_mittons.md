# Kitten Mittons (sic)

## Concept

An ad in the comically-bad
style of ASIF's [Kitten Mittons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNnEmd9jw8).

* Mix of spokesperson
  and voice-over.
* Huge exaggeration of AC impact.
* Awkward video editing.
* Hokey transition and sound effects.

## Script

(
Opens with a tight shot of the spokesperson
standing in a hacker-space.
Camera zooms out during opening line
revealing rest of AC team working at lab benches.
Spokesperson is awkwardly dressed
in either poorly-tied tie or bowtie.
Has obvious pit stains.
Speaks too loud.
Over the top facial expressions.
Awkward speaking cadence,
obviously trying to remember memorized lines.
Random hand gestures.
)

**Spokesperson(SP)**: Hello!
I'm (name),
Awesome Controller Co-Founder
and retro gaming enthusiast.

**SP**: Are your retro gaming console controllers
constantly causing you bodily harm?

*Cut to video of cord strangling*

**SP**: Do you often worry that
your Nintendo cord will become wrapped around your neck,
suffocating you?

*Cut to video of system being pulled into face*
*Timed cut to tombstone of person who got hit in the face*

**SP**: Have your game celebrations resulted in the
death of a friend, a loved one, or even yourself?

*Cut to video of hand being pulled off by controller*

**SP**: Have you lost
one, two, three or more hands
as a result of controller cord accident?

*Cut back to Spokesperson, now walking towards the camera*

**SP**: If you answered yes to any of these questions,
then you aren't alone, Stubby.
I actually lost both of my hands to a Sega Genesis,

*Spokesperson raises stubs into shot*

so I vowed to stop the violence.

*Back to SP walking towards camera with lab in background*

I commissioned a team of top scientists and engineers
to research potential solutions
and bingo was his name-o.

*SP trips and is seen to start to fall. Video cuts straight to him standing and walking again*

Awesome Controller was born.

*Still walking towards the camera*

**SP**: With Awesome Controller,
you use your existing wiimote or PS3 controller

*Three people walking down hallway. Controllers thrown
from behind camera, taking out each flanking member independently.
Over-the-top pratfalls ensue.
One person has papers they're holding which are thrown. The other has a pie.*

to control your
Nintendo,
Super Nintendo,
Nintendo 64,
Sega Genesis,
and more.
No Cords to worry about at all!

*Walking reveals someone strangling someone else with a controller cord.*
*Camera stops moving, SP walks off camera, focus stays on strangling *

*New shot opens with SP awkwardly posing with his leg up in the Captain Morgan stance*
*He's wrapped in a Soviet Flag*

**SP**: Take back the control from your controllers again.
Awesome Controller.
It's Awesome.
Controller.
