# Awesome Controller

Awesome Controller is a project that will let you play older video game systems with new wireless controllers. Imagine a world where your SNES or Genesis doesn't sit in a box because of all of the wires. We want to make a way for you play your NES, SNES, N64 (and more!) with Wii and PS3 controllers.

This project is a great fit for you if you have one or more older video game consoles collecting dust because they just don't fit with your wireless modern living room. You love old video games, and want to breathe new life into them.

So, Awesome Controller is a hardware device that can communicate both with video game systems and modern Bluetooth controllers.

Our team is made up of five guys in Indianapolis, Indiana. Four software engineers (mostly web-based) and an electrical engineer. From Final Fantasy to Zelda to Goldeneye 64, we've played a bunch of games. While most of us don't have much hardware development knowledge, we have gotten pretty far in the last few months.

## What have we done so far?

Awesome Controller started as a Startup Weekend project. We got to work disassembling NES and SNES controllers and reading online documentation to figure out how the systems worked. By the end of the weekend people were playing NES and SNES games on the original consoles with a wired PS3 controller. More importantly, we got a Wiimote connected to a NES, allowing us to play Super Mario Brothers from across the room.

Over the next few months we hit a few more important milestones, including being able to play N64 games and interfacing with the Wii Classic controller for more buttons.

## So why do a Kickstarter?

We are trying to raise $15,000 to prove that other people want a device like this before we add some features to make it production-ready.

There is still a lot to work on. The more backing that we get, the clearer the signal that we should work on this project. Some things that we would really like to get working for this first version include:

   - multiplayer support
   - at least the following systems flawless: NES, SNES, N64
   - PS3 wireless support

Your money will go largely toward production costs of the Awesome Controller unit, dongles to connect to systems, and shipping. We will probably make a little money on this Kickstarter, which compensates us somewhat for the time that we are putting in on this project.

We strongly believe in transparency. We will be communicating with you throughout and after the project. Everything from our code to schematics to the Kickstarter copy you are reading is available online and free of charge at [our Github page](https://github.com/awesomecontroller). If you're a developer, be sure to check out the tier that allows you to flash your Awesome Controller and upload new code to it. If you make some changes, we'd love to get a pull request and release it back for everyone to benefit.

## How can you help?

If you know retro gamers, we would greatly appreciate you telling them about this project.

We are trying to raise at least $15,000. Funds that you pledge are not taken out until the that minimum is reached. To encourage people to donate, we have several levels of funding that have special bonuses attached to them.
