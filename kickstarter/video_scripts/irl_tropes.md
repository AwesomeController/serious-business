# Video Games IRL

## Concept

70-90 seconds of video game inside jokes 
with sound effects 
and camera angles 
to mimic well known scenes/situations.
We'll follow a short narrative
while dropping fan service
like it's going out of style.

## Story Summary

* Voice-over narration 
  with silent on-screen 
  other than effects
* Follows our hero 
  from a tragic cord-related accident, 
  to inventing awesome controller 
  to using it
* Jumps from trope to trope
  as the story progresses

## Outline

### Intro: Define problem

* Hassle untangling cords
  for big bundle of systems.

  * Is there a puzzle game trope?

* Cat/Dog pulls cord, 
  ruining important game.
  
  * Raging trope? 
  * Life-losing sound?

* Hurt hand on non-ergonomic controller.
  
  * Heart meter goes down
  * Flash in/out of existence 
    like Zelda animation.

### Building AC

* Searching for solutions.
  
  * Breaking pots and slashing bushes 
    looking for things Zelda-style
  * Goldeneye terminal hacking
    as web search
  * Driving to game store Mario kart

* Don't find anything that exists

  * Retry/Quit dialog choice

* Discover Arduino

  * Zelda item acquired opening Arduino box
  
* Building AC Prototype

  * Party discovery from Final Fantasy
    to add rest of team
  * Jump and break power up block
    to gain arduino knowledge form
  * First-person split-screen view 
    with one person holding soldering iron
    and other holding a laptop

* Win startup weekend

  * Mario-kart style medal podium?
  * Using prototype, 
    is there a princess that was saved?

### Why Kickstarter for $$$

* Components needed in bulk

  * Starcraft "You require more vespene gas"

* Product improvements

  * Tech tree research? 
    Console games with tech trees?
  * 8-bit version of a case?

### More serious pitch

* Team introduction
* Just want to solve this problem for some folks
* Thanks
