# Awesome Controller

VIDEO

Awesome Controller lets you use your Wii and PS3 controllers
to play your classic game consoles.
Ditch your tangled mess of old controllers,
but keep all of your favorite old systems and games.
Breathe new life in to your NES, SNES, N64 (and more!)
with Awesome Controller.

## How does Awesome Controller work?

Getting up and running with Awesome Controller is a snap.

PICTURE OF AWESOME CONTROLLER

Awesome Controller plugs directly in to
your favorite console's controller port via a special dongle.
From there,
just wirelessly sync your Wii or PS3 controllers
to your Awesome Controller and
you're ready to dodge red shells and
blast bad guys.

## Who are you?

We're five gamer dudes in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Kyle (our fearless leader) decided he was tired of his "nearly-wireless living room"
and convinced the rest of us to spend nights and weekends building Awesome Controller.
Our four software engineer + one electrical engineer team won a Startup Weekend event
by demoing Super Mario Brothers played with a Wiimote from across a packed room.
It's not fair that we're the only kids on the block playing Mario Kart 64 with Wiimotes,
so we launched this Kickstarter to bring equality to the retro gaming universe.

## Which systems are supported?

We currently support:
* Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
* Nintendo 64 (N64)

The hardware is capable of supporting additional systems,
and if we hit higher funding goals,
we'll certainly add more support.
Even better,
because we're an open platform,
some badass on Reddit could give you Atari support for free.

## So why do a Kickstarter?

We are trying to raise $15,000
to prove that more than just the five of us want an Awesome Controller.
That's the level where a production run won't be too expensive for you,
and won't lose money for us.
When we tell our friends,
they tell us they'd love one,
so we're hoping you're just a friend we haven't yet met.

We have a ton of ideas for cool enhancements,
and the more interest we see,
the more of those cool things we can build.

## How many Awesome Controllers do I need?

One Awesome Controller can connect to two Wii/PS3 controllers simultaneously.
That means you probably only need one,
unless you want to play 4-player N64.

## What are dongles?

Dongles are the system-specific removable plugs that
connect your Awesome Controller directly to the console.
Each console has a slightly different controller port,
so these dongles allow you to buy just one Awesome Controller,
and switch dongles to play a different system.
If you have multiple console systems you'd like to play,
you'll want to pick up a dongle for each.

## Awesome Controller's future

Awesome Controller is a completely open platform,
with the source code and schematics on [github](http://github.com/awesomecontroller).
Members of our community are absolutely encouraged
to add console support,
add features,
and generally do all of the awesome stuff that happens when folks collaborate.
We've added the [Hacker's Tier]() specifically to encourage tinkering
from anyone who is familiar with the popular [Arduino]() open hardware platform.

## How can you help?

## FAQ

### How do I contribute?

Everything from our code
to our schematics
to the Kickstarter copy you are reading
is available online and free at [our Github page](https://github.com/awesomecontroller).
If you're a developer,
be sure to check out the Hackers Tier that allows you to easily
flash your Awesome Controller and upload new code.
Want to add support for the Atari Jaguar?
Awesome!
We'd love to get a pull request
and release it back for everyone to benefit.

### Can I use a Wiimote and a PS3 controller simultaneously?

Yup.

### Can I play two different consoles with one Awesome Controller simultaneously?

Nope.

## Reward Tiers

Interested in supporting Awesome Controller development,
but don't want to break the bank?
Pledge $5 and we'll keep you in the loop
with product updates,
and we'll add your name (plus a message of your choosing)
to the `KICKSTARTER_BACKERS.md` file in our github repository.

### $75
The Hackers tier

About a month before the "retail" launch,
we will send you a parts kit
with everything you need
to solder your own Awesome Controller arduino shield.
With this kit,
an arduino uno
and our free tutorials and documentation,
you too can be a baller hardware-hacking machine.

If you already are
the aforementioned baller hardware-hacking machine (BHHM)
then you can use these parts
to add your own twists to the hardware.
Maybe you can play networked multi-player N64
from your computer?
Maybe you let people play your SNES from a web app?
Maybe your Awesome Controller interfaces with your blender?
I don't know what sort of crazy thing you're in to (so please stop asking).

Also includes 1 system dongle of your choice

# Risks and Challenges

If our project is successfully funded, we will spend our time and effort on bluetooth coding, the case design for the product, and adding support for additional controllers and consoles.

Our prototype currently works for the NES, SNES, and N64 systems, but only one at a time. To switch to a different console, we currently have to recompile the software. For product release, we obviously need the device to auto-detect which system is connected and function appropriately. We've already begun to build our code in a way that makes this possible, but we need time and effort to finish this task.

The case design for the Awesome Controller currently exists only in our mind's eye. We need to create an actual design that can be sent off and manufactured.

If we have time and resources, we would love to add support for more classic game systems. So far we only support Nintendo systems, but this is not out of one-sided fanboyism. We'd like to support Sega, Atari, Playstation, etc as well. System support is one of the most difficult parts of the Awesome Controller project, however, and takes significant time and skill. 

1) Bluetooth
2) Case Design
3) Additional system or controller support
