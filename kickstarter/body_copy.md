# Awesome Controller

VIDEO

Awesome Controller lets you use your Wii and PS3 controllers
to play your classic game consoles.
Ditch your tangled mess of old,
broken controllers,
but keep all of your favorite old systems and games.
Breathe new life in to your NES, SNES, N64 (and more!)
with Awesome Controller.

## How does Awesome Controller work?

Getting up and running with Awesome Controller is a snap.

PICTURE OF AWESOME CONTROLLER

Awesome Controller plugs directly in to
your favorite console's controller port via a special dongle.
From there,
just wirelessly sync your Wii or PS3 controllers
to your Awesome Controller and
you're ready to dodge red shells and
blast bad guys.

## Who are you?

We're five gamer dudes in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Kyle (our fearless leader) decided he was tired of his "nearly-wireless living room"
and convinced the rest of us to spend nights and weekends building Awesome Controller.
Our four software engineer + one electrical engineer team won a Startup Weekend event
by demoing Super Mario Brothers played with a Wiimote from across a packed room.
It's not fair that we're the only kids on the block playing Mario Kart 64 with Wiimotes,
so we launched this Kickstarter to bring equality to the retro gaming universe.

PICTURE OF TEAM

## Which systems are supported?

We have a prototype that currently supports:

* Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
* Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
* Nintendo 64 (N64)

The prototype is running on an Arduino board and is hooked together with wires.
We have a USB host shield that has a USB bluetooth dongle,
hacked together with some code to make everything basically work together.

The hardware is capable of supporting additional systems,
and if we hit higher funding goals,
we'll certainly add more support.
Even better,
because we're an open platform,
some badass on Reddit could give you Atari support for free.

## So why do a Kickstarter?

We are trying to raise $15,000
to prove that more than just the five of us want an Awesome Controller.
That's the level where a production run won't be too expensive for you,
and won't lose money for us.
When we tell our friends,
they tell us they'd love one,
so we're hoping you're just a friend we haven't yet met.

The money will cover shipping,
manufacturing,
and parts,
with some left over for previous expenses and future development.

We have a ton of ideas for cool enhancements,
and the more interest we see,
the more of those cool things we can build.

## How many Awesome Controllers do I need?

One Awesome Controller can connect to two Wii/PS3 controllers simultaneously.
That means you probably only need one,
unless you want to play 4-player N64.

## What are dongles?

Dongles are the system-specific removable plugs that
connect your Awesome Controller directly to the console.
Each console has a slightly different controller port,
so these dongles allow you to buy just one Awesome Controller,
and switch dongles to play a different system.
If you have multiple console systems you'd like to play,
you'll want to pick up a dongle for each.

## How will this be implemented?

We've identified parts suppliers and manfacturers,
and figured out the costs of various batch sizes.
The Hackers Tier will be assembled by hand,
and we'll work to assemble the other tier rewards.

## Awesome Controller's future

Awesome Controller is a completely open platform,
with the source code and schematics on [github](http://github.com/awesomecontroller).
Members of our community are absolutely encouraged
to add console support,
add features,
and generally do all of the awesome stuff that happens when folks collaborate.
We've added the [Hacker's Tier]() specifically to encourage tinkering
from anyone who is familiar with the popular [Arduino]() open hardware platform.

## How can you help?

If you're a developer,
we'd love feedback,
suggestions,
or (even better) pull requests.

## FAQ

### How do I contribute?

Everything from our code
to our schematics
to the Kickstarter copy you are reading
is available online and free at [our Github page](https://github.com/awesomecontroller).
If you're a developer,
be sure to check out the Hackers Tier that allows you to easily
flash your Awesome Controller and upload new code.
Want to add support for the Atari Jaguar?
Awesome!
We'd love to get a pull request
and release it back for everyone to benefit.

### Can I use a Wiimote and a PS3 controller simultaneously?

Yup.

### Can I play two different consoles with one Awesome Controller simultaneously?

Nope.

### How does the Awesome Controller get power?

We've thought about doing a battery-backed solution,
but for now will probably stick with plugging it into A/C power.
This at least isn't the kind of wire that stretches across your living room and trips your cat.

### How do I get it?

We ship it.
We are only shipping to the United States.
Shipping cost is included in the tier costs.

Awesome Controller lets you use your Wii and PS3 controllers to play your classic game consoles.

Imagine using your Wiimote to play a game of Contra on your original NES. Later, you battle your friends on Block Fort in Mario Kart 64 with your PS3 controllers!

If the past, present, and future had a baby, that baby would be Awesome Controller.

#### Kyle

Hi, I'm Kyle and this is team Awesome Controller. We're five life-long gamers in Indianapolis.

I am a little bit of a wire-management freak, and I got tired of untangling the wires on my Super Nintendo controllers every time I wanted to replay Chrono Trigger. I Tom Sawyered four of my good friends and we built a working prototype of Awesome Controller in one weekend. Since then, we've worked hard to add support for new systems and new controllers. Now we want to share our hard work with all of you.

We launched this Kickstarter because it allows us to perform a larger production run, saving the maximum possible number of retro consoles from obscurity.

#### Anthony

Awesome Controller acts like a translater between your Wii or PS3 controllers and your game consoles. We built on existing research to translate the bluetooth signals to the protocols that the various game consoles understand. You connect your Awesome Controller via an interchangable dongle to your favorite system, sync your controller, and start playing. You'll only need one Awesome Controller, but you'll need a different dongle for each game console.

#### Kail

We strongly believe that open hardware and software result in a better experience for consumers, so we've already released all of our Awesome Controller work under open source licenses. Our goal is to create a community around the Awesome Controller, so others can freely customize their version. We're also releasing an Arduino shield version of Awesome Controller for developers and hardware hackers.

#### Alex

Our goal with Awesome Controller is to help people have more fun with the consoles they already own, and we need your help. Don't let your princess be in another castle. Support Awesome Controller. It's awesome. Controller.

# Risks and Challenges

If our project is successfully funded,
we will spend our time and effort on bluetooth coding,
the case design for the product,
testing,
and adding support for additional controllers and consoles.

The current prototype works pretty well with Wireless Wii and Wii Classic Controllers.
We still have to do some work on the PS3 wireless and getting multiple controllers (of any type) simultaneously connecting.

Our prototype currently works for the NES,
SNES,
and N64 systems,
but only one at a time.
To switch to a different console,
we currently have to recompile the software.
For product release,
we need the device to auto-detect which system is connected and function appropriately.
We've already begun to build our code in a way that makes this possible,
but we need time and effort to finish this task.

The case design for the Awesome Controller currently exists only in our mind's eye.
We need to create an actual design that can be sent off and manufactured.

Awesome Controller carries risks like any other engineering project.
Some design flaws can delay product releases by months.
Since this is a hardware product, having things work right before shipping is of utmost importance.

If we have time and resources,
we would love to add support for more classic game systems.
So far we only support Nintendo systems,
but this is not out of one-sided fanboyism.
We'd like to support Sega,
Atari,
Playstation,
etc. as well.
