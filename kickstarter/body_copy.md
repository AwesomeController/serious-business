# Awesome Controller

VIDEO

Awesome Controller lets you use your Wii and PS3 controllers
to play your classic game consoles.
Ditch your tangled mess of old controllers,
but keep all of your favorite old systems and games.
Breathe new life in to your NES, SNES, N64 (and more!)
with Awesome Controller.

## How does Awesome Controller work?

Getting up and running with Awesome Controller is a snap.

PICTURE OF AWESOME CONTROLLER

Awesome Controller plugs directly in to
your favorite console's controller port.
From there,
just wirelessly sync your Wii or PS3 controllers
to your Awesome Controller and
you're ready to dodge red shells and
blast bad guys.

## Who are you?

Our team is made up of five guys in Indianapolis, Indiana. Four software engineers (mostly web-based) and an electrical engineer. From Final Fantasy to Zelda to Goldeneye 64, we've played a bunch of games. While most of us don't have much hardware development knowledge, we have gotten pretty far in the last few months.

## How many Awesome Controllers do I need?

## Which systems are supported?

## Awesome Controller's future

Awesome Controller is a completely open platform,
with the source code and schematics on [github](http://github.com/awesomecontroller).
Members of our community are absolutely encouraged
to add console support,
add features,
and generally do all of the awesome stuff that happens when folks collaborate.
We've added the [Hacker's Tier]() specifically to encourage tinkering
from anyone who is familiar with the popular [Arduino]() open hardware platform.

## So why do a Kickstarter?

We are trying to raise $15,000
to prove that more than just the five of us want an Awesome Controller.
That's the level where a production run won't be too expensive for you,
and won't lose money for us.
When we tell our friends,
they tell us they'd love one,
so we're hoping you're just a friend we haven't yet met.

Additionally,
we have a ton of ideas for cool enhancements,
and the more interest we see,
the more of those cool things we can build.

## How can you help?

Spread the word!

We'd really appreciate if you sent them our way.
